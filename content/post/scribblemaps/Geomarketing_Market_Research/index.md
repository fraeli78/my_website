Today we are going to show you some real examples on one of the most advanced functionalities of Scribble Maps:

* Nearby Search.

Any time you have to travel to a new city, you would like to know in a short time, which could be the best area to choose your Hotel, B&B or farmhouse for example.

In order to find it, you would like to point out in your map where the most important services are located as per your interest. There are a lot of Apps that can help you by showing the hotels, restaurants, pubs, cinemas etc.
Scribble Maps simplifies it! Let us demontrate!

If you input a location such as Florence, to the search box, a new window will appear to help you to select the most popular categories from a list - such as Airport, Parking, Museum, Pharmacy, etc. You can also select the Range from 100 m to 50 km. This is an awesome functionality that is really useful in different contexts and analyses.
