Over the past 10 years, I have had extensive experience in managing nautical/urban cartographic data by GIS. I have had the pleasure of working for public and private companies as well as spending a one-year period in university research.

As modern technology is my passion, I have continued to work on projects centered around GIS, WebGIS, Database handling, and Python. Just to name a few.

Recently, I have strongly completed the 1st level Master's degree in Cyber Security to improve my knowledge.

I am happily married and I live in Pontedera, Italy. I love nature, travelling, and, walking with my labrador in the parks.
